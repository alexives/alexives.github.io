#### Part 2 - Decorate
This is important, I want this thing to look classy. So there are two major parts to this: the tap tower and countertop, and then the rest of the exterior.

For the tap tower, my plan is to get a piece of piping and just add a tap to it. Then I'll either use a flange or I'll figure something else out so that I can attach the tower easily to the inside of the lid.

For the counter top, Courtney said she would be willing to tile/mosaic something for me. So that's part of it. Also, since the top has that convenient pit in it made of plastic, I'm going to try and set it up to with a grill so liquid can drip into the tray.

For the rest of the exterior, my plan is two fold. Mostly, I'll paint the whole thing black, but for the parts that have the embossed writing on them, I'm going to go to the store and get some countertop laminate, like you'd put on an mdf based countertop sort of thing. Since it's so rigid, I don't think it'll show the writing very much and if I can smooth it out well I think it'll look pretty good with the black paint.

#### Part 3 - Plumbing
This is pretty much the boring part, I'll make all of the tubes attach to things.

#### Part 4 - Phase 2 CO2
For the second phase of CO2 usage, I'll add a secondary regulator inside of the kegorator. That SHOULD stop people's ability to mess with it too much. It won't stop someone from turning off the co2, but it will stop them from dangerously turning it up too far. 

#### Part 5 - Phase 3 CO2
For the third phase of CO2, I'll replace the external line with an internal one hooked up to something like a paintball co2 tank (cleaned of course). That should be small enough to sit inside and a 20 oz tank should be more than enough to serve an entire keg.
