This beer has one of the most complex hop aromas I've ever smelled. The blend of citrus and pine american hops. Unlike most american Double IPAs, the heady topper posesses an extraordinary amount of depth in the hop characteristics. In addition to the hops, there are subtle notes of malt that offer strong support for the hops. The hops have a primarily citrus aroma, but also have some notes of piney resin and also some light fruity esters.

Though I drank most of it from the can (as suggested), I did make sure to take a look at it. It was a straw yellow bordering on gold. Fairly hazy, there were actually some particulates that looked like hops, probably from dry hopping. The head was decently sized, white, and foamy.

The flavor offered much of the same that could be found in the aroma. There are deep complex hop flavors, with some sweetness from a malty base. The hop flavors impart notes of resiny pine, citrusy orange, and some light fruits. The maltiness imparts a slight sweetness, though the balances is slightly dry. Finish is dry. There is almost no hop bitterness, probably from the strong level of supporting hops.

Carbonation level was pretty medium, and while the sensation is a bit dry, there is no astringency. No warmth, though it does claim 8% ABV. No creaminess.

Some people think this beer is really overrated. Personally, I think those people are wrong. The complexity of the hops and the wonderful balance make this easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Not only is it an excellent example of the style, but it also is an excellent beer overall.
