I occasionally use a VPN to connect to things, and while it isn't a huge deal to use the little menu bar widget, it's much more convenient if I don't have to use the mouse. Hence, this alfred workflow. It looks through the set of configured vpns in Tunnelblick and then uses Tunnelblick's built in Applescript api to let you connect to them, or disconnect from all of them. It's nothing fancy, but I thought I'd throw it up here.

### From the README

This alfred 2 workflow is designed to interface with Tunnelblick's applscript api, allow you to connect or disconnect from various networks without interfacing with the menu.

It uses the keyword "vpn" and gives a variety of options based on the vpn configurations detected.
