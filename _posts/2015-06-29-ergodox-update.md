A while ago, massdrop re-vamped the ergodox into an even better thing than before. It now utilizes usb3, and they claim to have substantially reduced lag. So I broke down and bought their kit which comes with pre-soldered components. The unfortuneate side effect of this is that I don't get the parts until probably late august.

Not sure anyone is reading this and/or cares, but hey, maybe you do. For those of you who want to take a look, you can [see it here.](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox)

A brighter note, they just shipped my vortex backlit key-caps (PBT and POM, YAY!). They'll show up over a month before the keyboard does. Oh well.
