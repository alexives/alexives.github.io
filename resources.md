Resources for Learning Software Skills

The following is a set of resources for people looking to learn some coding skills.

### Command Line Tools
One good place to get started is an introduction to the command line. While not 100% required to learn to code, all of the best software engineers I know are highly proficient in it. I'd suggest looking here: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/

### General Programming
If you just want to dive in and learn some coding. [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/) is an interesting way to start. [My wife](http://courtney.ives.mn) got her start there and she enjoyed it.

### Ruby/Rails
If you're looking for something a little bit more practical, the [rails bridge curriculum](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/docs/) is a very good direction to go. After the "Installfest" section, each of the sections under rails has a small project that could be finished in a day. Their site is full of really uesful information. Also, there are RailsBridge workshops that happen all over the country.

### SQL/Postgres
If you have wants/needs to learn sql, this site seems to have some interesting exercises: https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html

### Regular Expressions
If you want to learn about regular expressions, doing [regex crosswords](https://regexcrossword.com/) are kind of fun and will really hone your skills.
